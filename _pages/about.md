I am currently a postdoctorial researcher at the [Interactive & Networked Robotics Laboratory](https://www.inrol.snu.ac.kr/). I recently received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Seoul National Universtiy under the supervision of Prof. Dongjun Lee.

My research focuses on developing intelligence for robotic manipulation involving contact interactions. During my Ph.D., I worked on theories of contact modeling and solvers for high-performance robotic simulators, as well as efficient algorithms for planning, estimation, and control related to contact dynamics. Currently, I am broadening my scope to explore the intersection of contact modeling, solvers, and machine learning. Additionally, I am actively involved in creating a software suite for robotic manipulation applications.
